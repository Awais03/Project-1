    margin: 10px 450px 10px 30px;">Gujranwala was founded by Gujjars in the eighteenth century however the exact origins of Gujranwala are unclear. Unlike the ancient nearby cities of Lahore, Sialkot, and Eminabad, Gujranwala is a relatively modern city. It may have been established as a village in the middle of the 16th century.Locals traditionally believe that Gujranwala's original name was Khanpur Sansi, though recent scholarship suggests that the village was possibly Serai Gujran instead - a village once located near what is now Gujranwala's Khiyali Gate that was mentioned by several sources during the 18th century invasion of Ahmad Shah Abdali (the great muslim ruler of Afghanistan region then).

    <p><span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(22, 7, 199); margin: 5px 30px 5px;">Sikh Era:</span></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;
    margin: 10px 450px 10px 30px;">In 1707, with the death of the last great Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Mughal power began to rapidly weaken especially following Nader Shah's invasion in 1739 and then completely dissipated from the Punjab region due to the invasions of Ahmad Shah Abdali who raided Punjab many times between 1747 and 1772 causing much devastation and chaos.
        Abdalis control over the region began to weaken in the latter part of the 18th century with the rise of the Sikh Misls (independent chieftainships usually consisting of the chief’s kinsmen) who overran Punjab.Charat Singh, ruler of the Sukerchakia Misl, established himself in a fort which he had built in the area of Gujranwala between 1756 and 1758.
    <img src="https://im.indiatimes.in/content/2016/Jun/6_1466512113.jpg" alt="Sardar Charat Singh">
    Nuruddin, a Jammu-based Afghan (Pashtun) general, was ordered by Abdali to subdue the Sikhs but was driven back at Sialkot by Sikh soldiers led by Charat Singh. In 1761, Khwaja Abed Khan, Abdali’s governor in Lahore, tried to besiege Charat Singh's base in Gujranwala but the bid misfired. The Sikh misls rallied to his support by attacking Afghan officers wherever they were found.A fleeing Abed Khan was pursued by Sikh contingents led by the Ahluwalia misl into Lahore, where he was killed.Charat Singh made Gujranwala the capital of his misl in 1763.
    In a 1774 battle waged in Jammu, Charat Singh of the Sukerchakia misl and Jhanda Singh of the powerful Bhangi misl, fighting on opposite sides, were both killed.Before his death, Charat Singh had become master of large and contiguous territories in the three doabs between the Indus and the Ravi. He was succeeded by his son Maha Singh who added to the lands that Charat Singh had not only captured but also capably administered.
    In the Gujranwala area in the 1770s, the Jat Chathas of Wazirabad and Rajput Bhattis of Hafizabad (Muslims in both cases) offered ‘fierce resistance’ to the Sukerchakias, whose attack was aided by Sahib Singh of the Bhangi misl.[15] Describing the conflict, the (British) writer of the Gujranwala Gazetteer wrote that, besieged for weeks in his fortress, Ghulam Muhammad Chatha eventually surrendered after Maha Singh assured him safe passage to Mecca, but the promise was ‘basely broken’ when Ghulam Muhammad was shot and his fortress razed to the ground. Rasoolnagar (Prophet's city) which belonged to the Chathas was renamed Ramnagar (Ram's city) to humiliate the Muslims. The Gazetteer noted that the treacherous killing of Chatha and his resistance was remembered ‘in many a local ballad’ in Gujranwala.[15] The Bhattis of Hafizabad tehsil, who were Muslim Rajputs, did not cease their resistance to the Sukerchakias until 1801, when their leaders were killed and their possessions captured.[15] Some Bhattis fled to Jhang.
    <img id="ranjit-singh" src="./images/ranjit.jpg" alt="Mahraja Ranjit Singh" style="margin: 5px 100px 5px 120px;">
   Ranjit Singh, Maha Singh's son and successor who would later go on to establish the Sikh Empire, was born in 1780 in Gujranwala's Purani Mandi market. Ranjit Singh maintained Gujranwala as his capital initially after rising to power in 1792. His most famous military commander Hari Singh Nalwa, who was also from Gujranwala, built a high mud wall around Gujranwala during this era and established the city's new grid street-plan that exists until the present day. Gujranwala remained Ranjit Singh's capital until he captured Lahore from the Durrani Afghans in 1799, at which point the capital was moved there, leading to the relative decline of Gujranwala in favour of Lahore.Jind Kaur, the last queen of Ranjit Singh and mother of Duleep Singh, was born in Gujranwala in 1817.

    <p style="text-align: justify;
    margin: 10px 450px 10px 30px;">The area was captured by the British Empire in 1848, and rapidly developed thereafter. Gujranwala was incorporated as a municipality in 1867, and the city's Brandreth, Khiyali, and Lahori Gates built atop the site of Sikh-era gates were completed in 1869. A new clocktower was built in central Gujranwala to mark the city's centre in 1906.
Christian missionaries were brought to the region during British colonial rule, and Gujranwala became home to numerous churches and schools.[7] The city's first Presbyterian Church was established in 1875 in the Civil Lines area - a settlement built one mile north of the old city to house Gujranwala's European population. A theological seminary was established in 1877, and a Christian technical school in 1900.

The North-Western Railway connected Gujranwala with other cities in British India by rail in 1881.The major Sikh higher learning institution, Gujranwala Guru Nanak Khalsa College, was founded in Gujranwala in 1889, though it later shifted to Ludhiana. The nearby Khanki Headworks were completed in 1892 under British rule, and helped irrigate 3 million acres in the province. Gujranwala's population, according to the 1901 census of British India, was 29,224. The city continued to grow rapidly for the remainder of British rule.
Riots erupted in Gujranwala following the <strong><em>Jallianwala Bagh Massacre</em></strong> in Amritsar on April 1919. These were some of most violent riots to the British Massacre. Riots lead to the damage of the city's railway station and burning of the city's Tehsil Office, Clock Tower, Dak Bangla and city courts. Much of the city's historical record was burnt in the attacked offices. Protestors in the city, nearby villages, and a procession from Dhullay were fired upon with machine-guns mounted to low-flying planes, and subjected to aerial bombardment from <strong>The Royal Air Force</strong> under the control of <em>Reginald Edward Harry Dyer</em>.
<img src="./images/railway.jpg" alt="Railway station Gujranwala" style="margin: 5px 100px 5px 90px;" >
According to the <em>1941 census</em>, 269,528 out of the Gujranwala District's 912,234 residents were non-Muslim.54.30% of Gujranwala city residents were Muslims prior to Partition, though non-Muslims controlled much of the city's economy. Hindus and Sikhs together owned two-thirds of Gujranwala's properties. Sikhs were concentrated in the localities of Guru Nanak Pura, Guru Gobind Garh, and Dhullay Mohallah, while Hindus were dominant in Hakim Rai, Sheikhupura Gate area and Hari Singh Nalwa Bazaar. Muslims were concentrated in Rasul Pura, Islam Pura and Rehman Pura.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(22, 7, 199); margin: 5px 30px 5px;">Modren Period:</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: justify;
 margin: 10px 450px 10px 30px;">The influx of Muslim refugees into Gujranwala drastically altered the city's form. By March 1948, over 300,000 refugees had been resettled in Gujranwala District. Many refugees found post-Partition Gujranwala lacking in opportunities, causing some to move south to Karachi. The refugee population mostly settled in localities that were mostly non-Muslim, like Gobindgarh, Baghbanpura and Nanakpura
Suburban districts were rapidly laid, including Satellite Town in 1950, which was designed mostly to house wealthy and upper middle-class refugees. D-Colony was built in 1956 for poorer Kashmiri refugees, and Model Town in the 1960s. The city experienced strong industrial growth during this period. In 1947, there were only 39 registered factories - a number which rose to 225 by 1961. The city's colonial era metal-working industry continued to grow, while the city became a centre of hosiery manufacturing that was run by refugees from Ludhiana. The city's jewelry-trade had been run by Hindus but came under control of refugees from Patiala. Gujranwala's economy continued to grow into the1970s and 1980s. 
 <img src="./images/flyover.jpg" alt="jinnah flyover">
 New development continues, such as the opening of a 5,774 foot long flyover that functions as an elevated urban expressway, as well as the nearby Sialkot International Airport which serves the entire Golden Triangle region, and is Pakistan's first privately owned commercial airport. Educations of higher learning have also been established in the city since independence. The Sialkot-Lahore Motorway, opened in 2020, passes near Gujranwala.

    margin: 0px 450px 10px 30px;">Gujranwala sits at the heart of the Rechna Doab - a strip of land between the Chenab in the north, and Ravi River in the south. Gujranwala is also part of the Majha - a historical region of northern Punjab. The city was built upon the plains of Punjab, and the surrounding region is unbroken plain devoid of topographical diversity.Gujranwala is 226 metres (744 ft) above sea level, sharing borders with Ghakhar Mandi and several towns and villages. About 80 kilometres (50 mi) south is the provincial capital, Lahore. Sialkot and Gujrat lie to its north. Gujrat connects Gujranwala with Bhimber, Azad Kashmir, and Sialkot connects it with Jammu. About 160 kilometres (99 mi) southwest is Faisalabad. To its west are Hafizabad and Pindi Bhattian, which connect Gujranwala to Jhang, Chiniot and Sargodha.

   margin: 0px 450px 10px 30px;">Gujranwala is the Pakistan's third largest centre of industrial production, after Karachi and Faisalabad. Gujranwala, along with the nearby industrial cities of Sialkot and Gujrat City, form what is sometimes referred to as the <em>Golden Triangle</em> in reference to their relative prosperity and export-oriented industrial base.The city's industries employ up to 500,000 people, while the city's GDP makes up 5% of Pakistan's overall economy.
    An estimated 6,500 small and medium enterprises, 25,000 cottage units, and some large factories, are located in and around the city as of 2002 and are engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of goods. The city is the centre for manufacture and export of sanitary fittings and wares in Pakistan, with over 200 producers based in Gujranwala. More than 60 producers of auto parts are found in the city. The city is well known as a centre formanufacturing electric fans with 150 small and medium
<img src="./images/gtdmc.jpg" alt="Gujranwala_Tools_Dies_and_Moulds_Centre">
enterprises in Gujranwala tied to the electric fan industry.[36] The city is <strong> <em>Pakistan's third largest centre for iron and steel manufacturinge</em> </strong>- reflecting Gujranwala's historic association with metalworking since the migration of the Lohar clan of blacksmiths to the city during the colonial era. The city has been a centre of hosiery-manfuacture since the migration of refugees primarily from Ludhiana in 1947.

Textiles, apparel, yarn, and other textile goods are also produced in Gujranwala. Other manufacturing based in the city include rice, plastic, cutlery, coolers and heaters, agricultural tools and equipment, carpets, glass goods, surgical equipment, leather products, and machinery for military uses, domestic appliances, motorcycles, and food products.This City also hosts the highest concentration of heavy industry in Punjab.he rural regions surrounding Gujranwala are heavily engaged in the production

 of wheat and are yield more wheat per acre than the national average. Gujranwala District is also the most productive region for rice-growing in Punjab.
 In 2010, Gujranwala was rated number 6 out of Pakistan's top 13 cities in order of ease of doing business by the World Bank, and was ranked the second-best in Pakistan for construction permits.Pakistan's electric shortages of the 2010s severely stymied the city's growth. Industrial units in the city suffered an average of 2872 hours per year in Gujranwala in 2012. By the end of 2017, the supply of electricity had drastically improved with augmented electric generation as a result of new power-stations coming online. Improved supplies of electricity contributed to the country's double-digit rise in exports in the second half of 2017. This brilliant city is also home of the one of the <strong>top 10 biggest companies in the world</strong> the <strong><em>Master Group of Companies.</em></strong>Hosting <strong><em>Asia's largest Scenetary market place.</em></strong>

Here the Guru had to sit and lie on a hard bed of pebbles (small stones) (ror-ree in Punjabi) as alluded to in Bhai Gurdas Varan.When the armies of Babar entered Punjab in 1521, Guru Nanak Dev was present in Gujranwala. At the time of capture of Gujranwala, many locals were arrested, among whom was Guru Nanak Dev Ji. At the time of the arrest, Guru Nanak was sitting on the pebbles and was busy in his prayers. The Gurdwara stands at the place of the pebbles.An imposing Gurdwara has been built over the place. A large pond and

Its central building is a three-storey imposing structure of cut brick work, which is topped with three chhatri-like structures covered with a large central gumbaz (dome) with smaller chhatris (dome-shaped pavilions) on either side. A rectangular hall adjoins it on the left side of the entry. A large sarovar, surrounded with low walls on two of its sides is set askew to the right of the central entry tower. At the rear of the complex there is a room topped with a particularly exquisite ribbed white lotus dome with a circumambulatory verandah. This room covers the pebbled area on which Guru Nanak was arrested.

At their height, his domains extended from the Khyber Pass in the northwest to the Sutlej River in the east and from the Kashmir region at the northern limit of the Indian subcontinent southward to the Thar (Great Indian) Desert. Although he was uneducated, he was a shrewd judge of people and events. His reign started in 1799 when he captured Lahore and ended in 1839 when he died. In little more than six years after his death, the Sikh state he had created collapsed because of the internecine strife of rival chiefs.”

<p style="margin: 5px 450px 5px 30px; text-align: justify;">Ranjit Singh, the great leader of the Sikh Empire, was born to Mahan Singh (1756-1792) in this stately haveli on November 13, 1780. His father, was the leader of the Sukerchakia Misl, one of many small principalities that arose in Punjab as Mughal rule faltered. Of necessity, the haveli reflected the wealth and eminence of Mahan Singh’s position, and his authority to rule, though the haveli was less ostentatious than many later examples such as the Omar Hayat mahal in Chiniot or the Nau Nihal Singh haveli, built by one of Ranjit Singh’s descendants. </p>

   <strong>Sohail Ahmad</strong> is a Pakistani writer, producer, comedian, and stage and TV actor.Sohail  was born on May 1, 1963, in <em>Satellite Town Gujranwala to Mian Muhammad Akram.</em> 
   The main reason for his fame is the comedy stage dramas produced in Lahore. Sohail Ahmad Azizi is famous for his eloquent dialogues. He is outspoken critics of women’s dance in stage plays. Although fans of stage dramas know Sohail as a comedian, most of his work on TV is of serious nature, especially in Pakistani television, where he has appeared mostly in serious and negative roles. He has experimented with a variety of roles, from a mercenary to a feudal lord. His role as Azizi in the Dunya News program <strong> “Hasb e Haal”</strong> became very popular.Sohail Ahmed has been associated with theater for a long time, and he provided a lot of entertainment to the people through his unparalleled art. However, his characteristic feature was that whenever he performed a stage play, there must have been some message in it, and the shows were free from obscenity and could be easily seen by the family members. A great example of this is <strong> ‘Fiqa in America.'</strong>About five years ago in 2015, Sohail launched a vigorous campaign to end immorality on stage dramas. Fakhri Ahmed and Ajmal Khan are those artists whose work has always impressed Sohail. He was inspired to become an actor by Ajmal Khan for playing the role of Kedo in the film ‘Heer Ranjha’. He is convinced of the laughter in which some bitter truth is hidden. He has so far won the Tamgha E Imtiaz, and the Pride of Performance in addition to these, he has won ten <em>Graduate, six Bolan Awards</em>, a <em> TV Lifetime Achievement Award,</em> and two <em> Best TV Actor awards.</em>

Bajwa was promoted to three-star rank and posted as field commander of the X Corps, stationed in Rawalpindi.He was appointed as Grade-I officer during his tenure as field commander of the X Corps.[20] The appointment was commented in the news media that noted that Lt-Gen. Bajwa had been posted in X Corps thrice, which is the <em>army's most important and largest corps,</em> which has experience of keeping control over the situation in Kashmir.On 22 September 2015, Lt-Gen. Bajwa was posted in the General Headquarters when he was appointed as the Inspector-General of the Training and Evaluation (IGT&E). There he was a Principal Staff Officer to the then-Chief of Army Staff, <em>General Raheel Sharif.</em>In 2016, General Raheel Sharif dismissed rumours of seeking the extension for his term.Initially, the race for the appointment for the army chief was rumored between Lt-Gen. Zubair Hayat and Lt-Gen. Javed Ramday who was close to the first family.However, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced to appoint the-then senior most army general, Lt-Gen. Zubair Hayat as the <em>Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.</em>On 29 November 2016, Prime Minister Sharif eventually announced to appoint General Bajwa - the fourth by seniority, as the Chief of Army Staff, superseding two generals who were senior than him. His strong pro-democracy stance and views may have influenced his appointment as the army chief as noted by the media pundits. The Reuters reported that Prime Minister Sharif picked Bajwa because of his low-key style. He was also noted as the fourth oldest Chief of Army Staff.In December 2016, he was awarded the <em><strong>Nishan-e-Imtiaz.</em></strong>

 Under the command of Gen. Bajwa, the nationwide counter-terrorism <em>Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad and Khyber-4</em> were launched in February 2017 and July 2017, respectively</p>
